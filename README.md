# GoEmulate
Game Boy Emulator in GO

This is a work in progress!

What we have
- Emulation for the original Game Boy (DMG)
- Run the boot rom

What we don't have
- GBC/GBA emulation
- Sound
- Pretty much everything else

GoEmulate is a learning project, and the first emulator I have ever even attempted. While I did write all the code it was heavily influenced by https://github.com/Humpheh/goboy
